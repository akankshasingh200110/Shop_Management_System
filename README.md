# Shop_Management_System

Shop management is an application that helps in managing the products and tracking the sales in the shop. This is a project that not only reduces labor and time but also helps the user have a record of the sales in a database.

This project uses the Tkinter and MySQL Connector modules in Python. MySQL Connector is used to store the details in a table and access them. Using this a GUI is built where the user gets to do the following:

# Add a product
# Delete a product
# View all products
# Generate a bill and store it in a database
